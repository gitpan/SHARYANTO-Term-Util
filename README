NAME
    SHARYANTO::Term::Util - Terminal utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of SHARYANTO::Term::Util (from Perl
    distribution SHARYANTO-Term-Util), released on 2014-06-07.

SYNOPSIS
     use SHARYANTO::Term::Util qw(hr);
     hr;

    Sample output:

     =============================================================================

     hr('x----');

    Sample output:

     x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x----x-

FUNCTIONS
  hr([CHAR]) => optional STR
    Print (under void context) or return (under scalar/array context) a
    horizontal ruler with the width of the terminal.

    "CHAR" is optional, can be multicharacter, but cannot be empty string.
    The defautl is "=".

    Under Windows, when printing, will shave one character at the end
    because the terminal cursor will move a line down when printing at the
    last column.

    Terminal width is currently determined using SHARYANTO::Role::TermAttrs,
    which will either use environment variable "COLUMNS" or detecting using
    Term::Size, or if all those fail, use a hard-coded default of 80.
